<b>README for the VIC pre-processor</b>

Changes:
- the input solar radiation is an instantaneous value which is treated as
 an average over the timestep. This is wrong. The value used should be 
interpolated between the values at the beginning and end of the hour by
linear interpolation or using zenith angle.
	- added a new field in the variables table to indicate that the data should be
	converted from instantaneous to average.
- also need to use some of the grib pds values to differentiate between the same variable
but from different sources
	- use the grib proc id which is unique to between EDAS, GOES and Stage IV and so 
	we use this to distinguish between the different precips and insolations


Todo:
- figure out how to convert goes from instantaneous to time averaged at the beginning of
the day, i.e. when GOES is missing at the beginning of the hour and has to be replaced
with EDAS data which is a time averaged value. Perhaps we can convert GOES to instantaneous
and use that to calculate the time averaged GOES value.
- remove variable table from code so that we can change the outputs without re-compiling
	- not done yet
- also edit the post-processor so that it lists the soil depths as variable
- put in a flag in the variable table that switches qc checking on/off instead of trying
to use the min/max values.
