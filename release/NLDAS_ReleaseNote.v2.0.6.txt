Release Note:  nldas.v2.0.2
V1.0.0 – release March, 2011
EMC quasi-operation version
V2.0.0 – release March 18, 2014
New Implementation on WCOSS
First implementation of the North American Land Data Assimilation System
(NLDAS) is to enhance US operational drought monitoring and prediction
capabilities and to support the National Integrated Drought Information System
(NIDIS) over the Continental United States (CONUS) domain.
Use NARR/RCDAS model data (radiation, 2 m air temperature and specific
humidity, 10-m wind speed, surface pressure) for atmospheric forcing.
Use observed precipitation forcing (gauge based, radar temporally
disaggregated)
Use bias-corrected downward shortwave radiation via satellite retrieved solar
radiation (GOES)
Four individual land surface models (NOAH, MOSAIC, VIC and SAC) are run in an
uncoupled mode.  The spatial resolution is 0.125 degree and the temporal
resolution is an hour.
River-Routing model uses the surface runoff and baseflow output from the above
four models and generates the hourly streamflow .
Jobs/components that will be implemented:
jnldas_prep
jnldas_noah, jnldas_mosaic, jnldas_vic, jnldas_sac
jnldas_rout_noah, jnldas_rout_mosaic, jnldas_rout_vic, jnldas_rout_sac
Output from the models
Forcing data in both grib1 and grib2 format
Model output data in grib2 format
Model restart files
River streamflow data in grib2 format
Computing resource information:
This NLDAS system runs only once per day (12Z).
Total runtime is about 50-60 minutes.
All the jobs will be running in serial mode, and the whole system will use at
most 3 processors during the runtime period.
Total disk usage is about 700 Mb per day.
Dissemination info:
The forcing (only the grib2 format), model output data and the river
streamflow data (all in grib2 format) will need to be sent out to the public.
Primary Users:
NIDIS
US Drought Monitor
NCEP Climate Prediction Center
Other external users such as Princeton University, University of Washington,
NWS/OHD, NASA/GSFC. COLA, Climate Cooperations.
Archive to HPSS:
All of the output data (including the restart files) will need to be archived
to HPSS.

V2.0.1 – release April 22, 2014
Description of changes
Updated parameters used in the grib2 table in the fix files.
Updated the source code that output the grib2 files to use appropriate
parameters in reference to the grib2 table.
Removed the comment-out lines for DBN_ALERT as we changed to use the "MODEL"
variable instead of the explicit one.
Commented out the alert for the "force-a" grib1 file, which is no longer
necessary.
V2.0.2 – release May 05, 2014
Description of changes
Additional updates of some parameters in the grib2 tables in the fix files, as
suggested by CPC.
Additional updates of the source codes that read/write the grib2 files to use
appropriate parameters in reference to the grib2 table.
Updated the Job scripts to use unified DBN alerts types for the NLDAS models.
Updated the ex-scripts to add error-check such that the model run (NOAH,
MOSAIC, SAC and VIC) will fail properly if they ever start ahead of the
Forcing job.
V2.0.3 ~@~S release June 09, 2014
Description of changes
Change NLDAS grib2 parameter tables in fix file to use simple packing
method, which include some parameters to control grib2 output such as
parameter ID, category, average/accumulate/simultaneous, decimal scale factor
etc. This fix focuses on reducing decimal number for some variables such as
soil moisture, surface pressure, snow water equivalent etc.
V2.0.4 ~@~S release November 24, 2015
Change due to CPC CMORPH data directory change in dcom (/dcom/us007003/20151122/wgrbbul/cpc_rcdas) and changed name from advt-8km-interp-prim-sat-spat-2lag-2.5+5dovlp8kmIR-2015112221 into CMORPH_8KM-30MIN_2015112221 as well as RCDAS file name change in dcom (RFC 1458)
V2.0.5 ~@~S release May 07, 2017
Change due to Stage II radar data from com into com2 and directory is also chnaged so that our ushell need to be chnaged to fit this change
V2.0.6 ~@~S release March 15, 2019
Use moudler for compiling, transition from wcoss phase 1 (tide) to wcoss phase (mars), coresponding change for ush and scripts, fix precipitation issue when cpc precipitation in dcom is missing if cpc compute farm fails (makeprecip.F90 and gridcpcnew.f in /nldas.v2.0.6/sorc/nldas_prep.fd/DRIVER/).
