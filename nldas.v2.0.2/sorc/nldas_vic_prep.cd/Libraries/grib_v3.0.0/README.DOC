To compile and create the GRIB library & related programs:

1) set system environment GRIB_ENV to point to the directory
   where the GRIB structure was installed.   
   When you go to $GRIB_ENV, you should see the following sub-dirs: 
   bin, config, data, doc, include, lib, libsrc, run, src, tables.

2) change directory to  $GRIB_ENV;
      unix>  cd $GRIB_ENV

3) Choose the TargetName which best suits your System Configuration.
   File 'config.os' comes with various Operating System configurations.
   To install, choose one of the following:

   unix> Install sgi_cc  <cr>		SGI (IP28) IRIX64 v6.2	
   unix> Install v5d_sgi_cc <cr>	SGI (IP28) IRIX64 v6.2, with vis5d
   unix> Install sun_acc <cr>		SunOS (sun4c) v4.1.3  (acc v.SC3.0.1)
   unix> Install sun_gcc <cr>		SunOS (sun4c) version 4.1.3 (v2.6)
   unix> Install XXXX <cr>		where XXX is name used in 'config.os'
					for your newly defined configuration
