----------------------------
- passed logical type copy of processor pmask to gribout so that
the grib files are written for only those cells which were 
simulated
- before they were output for all cells in the mask which may 
differ from the processor mask.
- changes made to get_mask.f
	- mask is not read from file but is instead filled with
	the logical value (T|F) equivalent of pmask
