!BOP
! !ROUTINE: landcover_plugin
!
! !DESCRIPTION:
!
! This is a custom-defined plugin point for introducing a new forcing scheme.
! The interface mandates that the following routines be implemented
! and registered for each model forcing scheme. 
!
!  \begin{description}
!  \item[retrieval of forcing data]      
!      Routines to retrieve forcing data and to interpolate them. 
!      (to be registered using registerget)
!  \item[definition of native domain]
!      Routines to define the native domain as a kgds array
!      (to be registered using registerdefnat)
!  \item[temporal interpolation] 
!      Interpolate forcing data temporally. 
!      (to be registered using registertimeinterp)
!  \end{description}
! Multiple forcing schemes can be 
! included as well, each distinguished in the function table registry
! by the associated forcing index assigned in the card file. 
!
