! !DESCRIPTION: 
!   This module contains the definition of the functions used for
!   incorporating a new observed radiation forcing scheme.

!BOP
! !ROUTINE: radforcing_plugin
!
! !DESCRIPTION:
!
! This is a custom-defined plugin point for introducing a new observed 
! radiation forcing scheme.
! The interface mandates that the following routines be implemented
! and registered for each of the forcing scheme. 
!
!  \begin{description}
!  \item[retrieval of forcing data]      
!      Routines to retrieve forcing data and to interpolate them. 
!      (to be registered using registerget)
!  \item[definition of native domain]
!      Routines to define the native domain as a kgds array
!      (to be registered using registerdefnatrad)
!  \item[Temporal interpolation]
!      Routines to temporally interpolate data
!      (to be registered using registerrti)
!  \end{description}
! Multiple forcing schemes can be 
! included as well, each distinguished in the function table registry
! by the associated forcing index assigned in the card file. 
!
